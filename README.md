## ‚ú® Features

- **üîç Automatic Server Testing**: Probes servers to determine optimal settings
- **‚ö° Multi-threaded Downloads**: Downloads files using multiple connections for faster speeds
- **üîÑ Concurrent Downloads**: Download multiple files simultaneously
- **üìä Speed Testing**: Tests server speed and detects throttling
- **üîÅ Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **üìù Batch Downloads**: Load multiple URLs from a text file
- **üéØ Range Request Support**: Automatically detects and uses partial content when available
- **üìà Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress and status updates

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/download-manager.git
cd download-manager

2. Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Create a `download_links.txt` file in the same directory as the script:
txt
# Add your download links here, one per line
https://example.com/file1.zip
https://example.com/file2.pdf
https://example.com/file3.mp4

2. Run the script:
bash
python script.py

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the maximum number of concurrent downloads
   - Specify the download directory (or press Enter for current directory)

### Advanced Configuration

The script will automatically:
1. Test the first URL for server capabilities
2. Determine the maximum number of threads the server allows
3. Measure download speed
4. Optimize settings for best performance
5. Download all files using the optimal configuration

## üîß How It Works

### Server Testing Phase

1. Range Request Support ‚îÄ‚Üí Checks if server supports partial downloads
2. Thread Limit Test ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Tests how many concurrent connections are allowed
3. Speed Test ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Measures download speed and detects throttling

### Download Phase

1. Single-threaded ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí For servers without range support
2. Multi-threaded ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Splits file into chunks for parallel downloading
3. Concurrent ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Downloads multiple files simultaneously

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The `DownloadConfig` class contains all configurable parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_concurrent_downloads` | 3 | Number of files to download simultaneously |
| `threads_per_download` | 4 | Initial threads per file (auto-optimized) |
| `chunk_size` | 1MB | Size of each download chunk |
| `timeout` | 30s | Request timeout |
| `retry_attempts` | 3 | Number of retry attempts on failure |

## üêõ Known Issues

- Some servers may have aggressive rate limiting that isn't detected in the initial test
- Very large files (>4GB) might need additional handling on 32-bit systems
- Servers that don't properly implement HTTP range requests may cause issues

## üöß Roadmap

- [ ] GUI interface using Tkinter/PyQt
- [ ] Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- [ ] Download queue management
- [ ] Bandwidth limiting options
- [ ] Proxy support
- [ ] Authentication support (Basic, OAuth)
- [ ] Download scheduling
- [ ] Chrome/Firefox extension for capturing downloads
- [ ] Configuration file support (YAML/JSON)
- [ ] Download history and statistics

## üí° Tips

- For best performance, ensure your internet connection isn't the bottleneck
- Some servers limit connections per IP - the tool automatically detects this
- Use fewer concurrent downloads for servers with strict rate limiting
- The tool works best with servers that support HTTP range requests
